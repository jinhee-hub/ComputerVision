# Mask2Former

Masked attention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former)

## Aims

Mask2Former is an architecture that can be used in any image segmentation task.
- Semantic Segmentation   :   [Assigning each pixel of an image to one of multiple classes]
- Instance Segmentation   :  [Segmenting each object instance in an image, and assigning each pixel of an instance to its instance class ID]
- Panoptic Segmentation   :  [Combining Semantic segmentation and Instance segmentation - Assigning each pixel of an image to either a class or an instance ID]
