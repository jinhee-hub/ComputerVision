# MVAR

This model decoupled VAR model into two groups.
- ### Intra-scale modeling

  Intra-scale modeling captures local spatial dependencies within each scale.
  
- ### Inter-scale modeling

  Inter-scale modeling progressively models cross-scale relationships from coarse to fine details.

-> More coputationally efficient than VAR
