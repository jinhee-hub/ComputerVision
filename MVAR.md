# MVAR

## Aims

MVAR optimizes VAR's computational structure. 

This model decoupled VAR model into two distinct parts: intra-scale modeling and inter-scale modeling
- ### Intra-scale modeling

  Captures local spatial dependencies within each scale.
  
- ### Inter-scale modeling

  Semantically connects features across different scales.
  

-> More coputationally efficient than VAR
