# MVAR

## Aims

MVAR optimizes VAR's computational structure. 

This model decoupled VAR model into two distinct parts: __intra-scale modeling__ and __inter-scale modeling__
- ### Intra-scale modeling

  Captures local spatial dependencies within each scale.
  
- ### Inter-scale modeling

  Semantically connects features across different scales.
  

-> More coputationally efficient than VAR
